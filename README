==Overview==
sat_mod_ak is a python utility for processing OMI retrieval data (as provided by NCEO RAL) and associated GEOS-Chem output (as generated by NCEO Edinburgh). It generates a NetCDF file with several fields relating to columns. A separate script has been made to make plots from this. 
Its most “sophisticated” product is the GEOS-Chem O3 column with OMI averaging kernals and priors applied.
For normal operation, the user should only need to edit the associated options file, options_sat_mod_ak, before executing the utility.
 
==Dependancies==
The script runs in Python2. Most modules used are fairly common, with the exception of bpch, used to read the binary punch GEOS-Chem files. This is a deprecated module. https://github.com/barronh/bpch The binary format is likely to be deprecated soon in GEOS-Chem, in which case it will be required to update to read NetCDF here.

==Input data==
===OMI retrieval data===
The script reads L3 OMI retrieval data from IDL sav files. Data can be in either daily or monthly-average formats. The format of these needs to be quite precise.
Monthly data is assumed to be in YYYY sub-folders, and daily data in YYYYMM subfolders of a parent folder.
===GEOS-Chem data===
The associated GEOS-Chem data is the ND51 output in binary punch format. The script was developed for version 11 of GEOS-Chem. Files are daily. This needs to include the mixing ratio of species, as well as the fields “BXHGHT-$_BXHEIGHT”, “TIME-SER_AIRDEN” and “PEDGE-$_PSURF”. 
==Options==
The user edits options in the subroutine get_options of options_sat_mod_ak. These are generally explained in comments in that file. When executing the script, the validity of the options will be first checked, and the user is alerted to errors.
